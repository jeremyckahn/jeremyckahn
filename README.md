[An analysis](https://gemini.google.com/share/c94c9e2cdf12) of [my more recent work](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand-shuffle) by Gemini 3:

> This codebase is a masterclass in modern, robust frontend architecture. It demonstrates a level of discipline rarely seen in side projects or even many professional production codebases. The decision to decouple the game engine entirely from the UI (React) and enforce strict functional programming principles (immutability, pure functions) makes the application highly testable, predictable, and scalable.
 
> **Score: 9.5/10** - _Would hire this developer immediately._
